# Surprise for Butku! — Multi‑page Valentine Website

## What’s inside
- `index.html` — the main playful question with runaway **No** button.
- `story.html` — timeline for your milestones.
- `gallery.html` — photo grid (replace images in `assets/images`).
- `playlist.html` — embed your songs / playlists.
- `letter.html` — a sweet love letter.
- `countdown.html` — live countdown to Feb 14 every year.
- `styles.css` and `script.js` — shared style and behavior.

## How to use
1. Open **index.html** to preview locally.
2. Replace placeholder images in **/assets/images** with your photos (keep names or update `gallery.html`).
3. Edit text in each page to make it yours.
4. To host for free:
   - **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo, upload these files, and enable Pages (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).
   - **Netlify / Vercel**: Drag‑and‑drop the folder on their dashboard.

## Custom tweaks
- Colors: update CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
- Hearts speed/density: change the interval in `script.js` (default 350ms).
- Countdown target: it auto‑rolls to the next Feb 14 based on viewer’s clock.

Made with ❤️ — enjoy!
